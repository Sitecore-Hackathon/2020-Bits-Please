# Sitecore Hackathon Website

##User Registration Module:

This module is for all people that want to register and have no team yet and can register to find out about Sitecore Hackathon’s events, past events, and other stuff. This should be as simple as an email and password. After that it will be redirected to a profile where they can add their github account, their linkedin handle and their linkedin url. When the profile is ready and the competition is ready to start then the user will be able to sign in and register with other teams, according with what goes on the registration module. 

##Team Registration Module: 

The sitecore hackathon has a been all years and needs a redesign and new functionalities. What we prupose is to create a module for registering the teams, and that is made automatic by the system in sitecore. The registration will create a repository in github once the competition starts. As soon the competition starts the timer will run giving the participants the time allocated in order for them to plan their projects accordingly. This idea is to help the organization with their manual tasks of their repositories on github to make their job easier. 

##Team Submission Module:

The team is able to submit their code, their sitecore app, and their video once before the timer goes off. As soon as the timer goes off, the people will not be able to upload any other file. This is the end of the Team submission Module. 
##Judge Evaluation Module:

The judges will have the list of all the team participants and will be able to rate the participants after they have seen video, code, and module of sitecore. After that the system will calculate an average from all the judges for all the judges per category. After that it will sort the qualifications and will list the participants and will present the winners. This can have a release results by the admin and then it will be shown to the public. The public will see after that the winners and see their module , video and their code so they can be inspired for the next year’s Hackathon. 
##Twitter Feed Module:

This module will show the twitter feed of the module representing the hashtags needed for it. It will be displayed with the number of tweets the editor wants to display. This should be controlled by the editors and therefore can add or delete if they think is necessary.
